Fixed bug where exponential decimals in "Corrupt&Repeat" wouldn't work
Fixed an oversight where "Corrupt&Repeat" would bombard you with errors if you made one mistake.

One can now press enter on the file select screen and save preset screen
Sorry Telic, I'm not changing the slashes that face the other way :)

Added Rare as a bugtester
Added option to create a newFolder for storing "Corrupt&Repeat" results
