The 1.2 update of the Scares Scrambler has been the longest update to make so far, mostly because of some huge behind-the-scenes code overhauls. Here's a list of new features that may interest you:
	-Corrupt & Repeat: Generate multiple corrupted files at once!
	-New Dubby Theme: Don't ask.
	-New Folder Selector: For getting exact paths for the corrupted file.
	-Two New Algorithms: Smoother and Blender; they're pretty fun.
	-UI Update: Just some small quality-of-life improvements.
	-Corruption Progress Bar: Blink and you'll miss it.
	-Mixer Algorithm: You'll never know.
	-Bugfixes: Because hey, why not?
	-Probably Other Stuff I'm Forgetting

Hope you have fun with all the new stuff!
