Hey! Thanks for trying out the Scares Scramber! If you're not sure how to work this thing, then watch the tutorial videos I made (which may or may not be released yet, depending on when you're using this). 

If you think the corrupter has frozen, give it a couple seconds. Since Python is an interpreted language, the corrupter may be a bit slow when corrupting bigger files. It is possible that we missed a bug in the code, so if you really, really think it crashed, then don't be afraid to tell me or look in the code to investigate!

Like it says in the about window, feel free to mess around in the source code and add your own things. If you want to release your own modified version, just be sure to give me credit somewhere, and I'll be happy! :)

Last point, and I think this one is obvious. This corrupter is still very young (one year to be exact). There's probably a whole bunch of bugs that slipped through me and the bugtesters. Don't expect this to work 100% perfectly yet.

Anyways, that's really all I have to say. Enjoy the corrupter!
