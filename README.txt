Hey! Thanks for trying out the Scares Scramber! If you're not sure how to work this thing, then check out the tutorial on my channel, scares009.

Now, there's a lot of hidden files in this folder. The corruptor needs these files in order to function properly, so please don't move, rename, or delete any of them. Making them visible is fine I guess.

If you think the corruptor has frozen, give it a couple seconds. Since Python is an interpreted language, the corruptor may be a bit slow when corrupting bigger files. It is possible that we missed a bug in the code, so if you really, really think it froze or crashed, then don't be afraid to tell me or look in the code to investigate!

Like it says in the about window, feel free to mess around in the source code and add your own things. If you want to release your own modified version, just be sure to give me credit somewhere, and I'll be happy! :)

Last point, and I think this one is obvious. This corruptor is still very young. There's probably a whole bunch of bugs that slipped through me and the bugtesters. Don't expect this to work 100% perfectly yet.

Anyways, that's really all I have to say. Enjoy the corruptor!
