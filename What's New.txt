Hey y'all! It's been a while since I updated this thing! Here's a list of (mostly) everything that's new in this update:

-Added a proper "Open File" window for selecting files to corrupt.
-Added a way to save and load corruption presets. The corrupter will automatically open the first preset file it finds when opened.
-Added hexadecimal support.
-Added a dark mode.
-Added an icon for the window and .exe file.
-Added the ability to change algorithms with the arrow keys.
-Improved some UI stuff.
-Improved some code (not that you care).

-Fixed a bug with negative numbers in the "Incrementer" algorithm.
-Fixed a bug with the random block space that caused the corrupter to freeze.
-Fixed a bug with exponent spacing where the exponent would get too big and wouldn't corrupt.

-Removed Herobrine.

Hope you have fun with this new stuff! :)))
